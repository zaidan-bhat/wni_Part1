<h1> This is a linear regression model, I have performed min-max normalization on the input attributes(X_train and X_test). 
I extracted the columns from the dataframe because verify_prediction method was not accepting ndarrays an inputs. So I changed to the format used
in the sample code by initializing the y_pred array in the same manner and then populating it with the predicted values.
